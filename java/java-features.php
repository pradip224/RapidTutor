                <h1>Java Features:</h1>
                <p>Most striking features of java that differs it from any other programming languages are:</p>
                <ul class="bullets wall">
                    <li>Simple</li>
                    <li>Portable</li>
                    <li>Robust and Secure</li>
                    <li>Object Oriented</li>
                    <li>Multi-threaded</li>
                    <li>Platform Independent</li>
                    <li>Compiled and Interpreted</li>
                    <li>High Performance</li>
                    <li>Distributed</li>
                    <li>Dynamic</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2><b>Simple</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java is relatively easier to understand and learn if you have some previous programming experiences because it has the same syntactical features of C and C++ which makes it easier to understand the language.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2><b>Portable</b>:</h2>
                <p>Portability is simply means that how easily a java program can run on all the other platforms.This feature makes it easier to run the code anywhere once it is written.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Robust and Secure</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java is very much Robust and Secure because of its strict compile and run time data type checking.</p>
                <p>Java has garbage collection which makes efficient use of the memory and exception handling eliminates any risk of crashing the system.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Object Oriented</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java is a true object oriented programming language that means that everything in java is treated as one Object.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Multi-Threaded</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java handles multiple tasks simultaneously by using the concept of Threading.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Platform Independent</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java is a platform independent language because once written and compiled it generates intermediate codes which can further be executed on any other platforms.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Compiled and Interpreted</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java is both compiled and interpreted means that it holds both the features while executing the code. First the code is compiled to intermediate bytecode and then the java interpreter interpretes the bytecode and generates the machine code.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>High Performance</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java incorporates the intermediate bytecode and uses garbage collection and the concept of threading reduces the overheads and enhances the overall performances. </p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Distributed</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java can be used to create applications for the distributed environment of the Internet.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><b>Dynamic</b>:</h2>
                <p>Java is a Dynamic programming language means at runtime code can be Dynamically linked.</p>
                <br>
