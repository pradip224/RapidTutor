                <p class="wall">Java is an object oriented programming language used to develop web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps and games etc.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems,Inc in 1991 in USA.</p>
                <p>It was initially called as Oak but later renamed to java in 1995.</p>
                <p>It follows the Object Oriented Paradigms.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It inherits some of the features of both the languages C and C++.</p>
                <p>Java is the first programming language which is platform independent. ie, it is not tied to any particular hardware device.
                </p>
                <p>Once written in java it can then run on any system.This is why java has the slogan: "Write Once Run Anywhere"</p>
