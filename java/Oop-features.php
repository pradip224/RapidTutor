                <h1>Object Oriented Programming Features:</h1>
                <p>Object Oriented Features consists of class and objects where classes contains data and methods inside them and we create Object <span class="" style="color: coral;">(instance of the class)</span> to access those data and methods.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Java Object Oriented Features are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="bullets wall">
                    <li>Data Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Binding</li>
                    <li>Message Passing</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>Data Abstraction:</h3>
                <p>Abstraction means hiding the internal complexities from the user and only showing them the essential features. In java using class and object we are hiding the internal implementation details</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Encapsulation:</h3>
                <p>Encapsulation refers to the fact of binding data and code inside the class so that they can not be accessed or misused from outside. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Inheritance:</h3>
                <p>Inheritance is the oop feature where one class can acquire the properties of another one. Using Inheritance we can reuse the existing code and combine the features of several classes.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Polymorphism:</h3>
                <p>Polymorphism is a Greek word means "many forms".</p>
                <p>Using Polymorphism one general action can exhibit different behaviour depending upon the nature of situation or data used in the operation.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Dynamic Binding:</h3>
                <p>Dynamic Binding refers to the fact where code to be executed on method call is resolved at runtime.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Message Passing:</h3>
                <p>Message passing is the communication between several objects which are sending and receiving information among them.</p>
